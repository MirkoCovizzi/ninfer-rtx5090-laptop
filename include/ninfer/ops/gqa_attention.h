/**
 * Shared numerical contract for A1/A2/A3.
 *
 * Public q/k/v inputs and BF16 cache values are interpreted after their BF16 storage boundary.
 * INT8-G64 cache rows use one FP16 scale for each contiguous 64-element group. For BF16 source
 * values x, their exact observable encoding is:
 *
 *   a          = max_i abs(FP32(x[i]))
 *   scale_bits = FP16_RNE(a / 127)
 *   s          = FP32(scale_bits)
 *   inv        = s == 0 ? 0 : FP32(1 / s)
 *   code[i]    = s == 0 ? 0 : I8(clamp(RNE_even(FP32(x[i]) * inv), -127, 127))
 *   decode[i]  = FP32(code[i]) * s
 *
 * A1 and A2 produce identical code and scale bits. The common ideal attention oracle uses BF16 Q
 * and logical cache values (BF16 values for a BF16 cache, FP32 decode above for INT8-G64), then
 * evaluates score dot products, stable softmax, and value reduction in FP64. The BF16 Op output is
 * promoted to FP64 for comparison with that result.
 *
 * The registered INT8 implementation defines Q8-G64, paired with INT8-G64 K, as its native query
 * compute profile. Its profile-defined query quantization and any narrower staging do not replace
 * BF16 Q in the ideal oracle. BF16-cache and INT8-cache compute profiles therefore have separate
 * named numerical criteria owned by the GQA conformance test. Those envelopes apply to the
 * registered geometries, tested token extents, conformance matrix, and target-representative
 * activation range; they are not a universal error bound for arbitrary adversarial BF16 tensors.
 * A1 and A3 are each qualified directly against the ideal oracle. A1-versus-A3 parity is only an
 * additional consistency check.
 *
 * KVarN cache positions are interpreted from either their live BF16 rotated tail or the exact
 * represented decode of stored K4/V2 codes and FP8/FP16 metadata defined by kvarn.h. Its
 * production profile applies the same orthonormal Hadamard transform to Q/K/V and the self-inverse
 * transform to Out. Qualification independently decodes the represented cache, evaluates the
 * complete model-space formula against the same FP64 oracle, and owns separate implementation and
 * compression-quality criteria. BF16 decode staging is a private implementation profile, not a
 * semantic cast boundary.

 * A1: append K/V for B independent sequences and compute causal grouped-query attention. Let
 * Vb=W when valid_columns is empty and Vb=valid_columns[b] otherwise. For row b, query head h,

 *
 * The registered geometries are `[256,24|4,W,B]` group 6 and `[256,16|2,W,B]` group 8.
 * q/k/v/out are contiguous BF16 in request-major order, positions is contiguous I32 [W,B], and
 * kv_table_rows is contiguous I32 [B]. valid_columns is either contiguous I32 [B], or an empty
 * Tensor meaning every row has exactly W valid columns. This dense/masked choice is part of the
 * call topology; it is not inferred by copying device metadata to the host. B=1 accepts every
 * positive W in the current prefill/decode domain; B=2..8 accepts W=1..16. Cache storage is BF16,
 * INT8-G64, or KVarN NVFP4-K/V2-G64 under the shared numerical contract above.
 * PagedKVBatchLayerView supplies shared planes and the complete block-table matrix;
 * kv_table_rows[b] selects one row for sequence b.
 *
 * In masked form, every row's valid columns are the prefix [0,valid_columns[b]); positions in that
 * prefix are sequential and address populated causal histories. Each nonempty row repeats its
 * final valid position through the invalid tail; an empty row uses zero positions. Other
 * invalid-tail inputs contain safe dummy values. A1 does not modify cache for invalid columns and
 * writes exact BF16 zero to their output. The caller guarantees that the maximum final valid
 * position plus one over nonempty rows lies in the declared execution envelope. The envelope is a
 * host launch-resource promise over that batch maximum; it does not alter any row's causal mask.
 *
 * q/k/v/positions/valid_columns/kv_table_rows/out, every cache plane/table, and live workspace
 * suballocations are pairwise non-overlapping. The Op overwrites every addressed cache row but
 * owns no persistent frontier, allocation, request identity, or commit authority. For KVarN
 * small-T execution, every completed staged page is encoded before attention while its BF16 marker
 * remains live. Each query column reads its current page from that BF16 tail and completed preceding
 * pages from encoded storage, matching sequential T=1 representation transitions.
